        <br>
        I graduated from the University of California Irvine in June of 2022, with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Game Science.  I specialize
        in game design and programming, and I've worked with projects across a variety of genres.  In my free time, I enjoy creating small passion
        projects in Unity and Unreal Engine 5 to learn more about each engine.  I also have been learning how to mod Android apps to make custom mods
        for Plants vs Zombies 2.  Beyond that, I enjoy drawing (though I'm not very good at it), as well as playing Wii Fit and doing weekly zoom
        yoga with my family to stay in shape.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m currently working part time at The Coder School, where we teach kids how to code using a personalized curriculum.  We work in 1-on-1
        and 2-on-1 sessions to help kids learn at their own pace.  I was also the lead designer and a programmer on Patient Zero, a VR game created
        with Unity, in association with the Biology department at the University of California Irvine.
        <br>
        <br>
        My favorite games include almost anything from Nintendo, especially Mario and Kirby games.  I also enjoy games that give a lot of personality
        to their characters, such as Undertale, Plants Vs. Zombies, Cuphead, Punch Out, Overwatch, or Team Fortress 2. As far as multiplayer games go,
        I enjoy Super Smash Bros, and team shooters like Splatoon, Rainbow Six Siege, Valorant or Marvel Rivals.

            Currently, I am working as a Unity Game Developer and Designer at Genies, where I create games for their mobile gaming
            platform.  I create design documents to pitch game ideas to my supervisor, then begin creating the games in Unity.  During
            the development process, I have weekly meetings with senior engineers to report my progress, and get feedback from testers
            and other members.  To make games for Genies’ gaming platform, I have had to learn new frameworks and modified coding languages
            to utilize tools developed by the company.  This has primarily involved integrating user traits and avatars used by players
            into my game, and creating mechanics that revolve around each.  I have also been one of the first people to test new updates
            to the framework that rework the whole system.  While working with this new framework, I test its limits, and document any
            bugs found in bug reports.

            I am currently working at Unscrolled as a Game Designer and Developer.  We are in the process of creating a Unity mobile game.
            My primary duties involve playtesting the game to identify areas where players could get stuck, and design ways to guide them
            through it.  This has typically been accomplished utilizing level design changes, such as rearranging geometry to better
            indicatewhere a player can hide in a stealth section.  I document bugs I find while playtesting on the team ClickUp, with
            detailed instructions to aid in fixing them at a later time.  I then meet with other developers to convey these issues,
            as well as ideas on how to resolve them.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a Designer, I meet with other members of the team to plan out upcoming levels and new mechanics for the game.  Using Miro,
            we map out our plans, ensuring that the levels are both intuitive to navigate and engaging to the players.  As a Developer, I
            create these levels, implementing assets according to the design documents.  I’ve also worked with the 3rd person camera,
            changing its behavior to ensure its movements are smooth, even when the player’s movements are erratic.  I coordinate with
            other testers to fine tune the camera, as well as other aspects of the game to create a polished experience.
