            I'm currently working part time at The Coder School at Irvine, California.  Dedicated to teaching kids how to code, The Coder School 
            employs a non-static curriculum to teach regardless of how they learn.  Working as a remote coach, it's my job to come up with curriculums, 
            tailored to their speed and abilities.  I utilize different techniques, such as metaphors and analogies, to gain understanding among students.
