          Created during a 24 hour game jam, Flower Feast is a 2D Unity game inspired by Minicraft.  The player plays as Rosy, a Rose in a flowerpot with wheels,
          who goes around collecting ingredients to create a variety of differnt cuisines.  Different materials are found in different environments across the map, 
          with some only being obtainable by defeating enemies.  I worked as a designer and programmer for the game deciding upon the overall game loop and systems for the game.
          As a programmer, I worked on creating the player and enemies to populate the map.  This involved creating their movement, attacks, and behavior.  I also worked towards
          implmenting their animations, utilizing Unity's blend trees to create smooth transitions between different animations.

            Roach Game is a local assymetric multiplayer party game.  I created it as a team of 5 over the course of 3 months.
            It involves one player playing as a roach and one player playing as a human.  The humans job is to kill the roach within the time limit,
            While the roach must survive.  Our goal with the game was to utilized sized in a unique way.  Many multiplayer have the players be simialr sizes
            with similar amounts to movement to reach areas.  In Roach Game, the human is nearly 50x taller than the roach,  while the roach is small and nimble,
            being able to scale walls and run under objects to try to outmaneuver and escape the human.  I served as the amin programmer for the project, 
            creating the movement and camera for the first person human and thrid person roach.  I also created all of the humans weapons and a system for
            them to swap between them, complete with attacking and switching aniamtion trees.

            Patient Zero is a virtual reality being developed in Unity. It is being created in association with the department of Biology at the University
            of California Irvine, and is geared towards converying biological concepts in an interactive manner.  I am currently serving as the design
            producer and head programmer for the project.
  
            As design producer, I've been maintaing the game's design document and coordinating the art, programming, and design departments 
            to realize the visual design and feel of the game.  I've also made changes to the levels to better accomodate for players of different
            heights and physcial abilities.
