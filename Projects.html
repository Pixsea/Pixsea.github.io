              Patient Zero is a virtual reality game that was developed in Unity. It was created in association with the Department of Biology at the
              University of California Irvine, and is geared towards conveying biological concepts in an interactive manner.  I served as the Design Producer
              and a Programmer for the project.
              <br>
              <br>
              As Design Producer, I maintained the game's design document, and coordinated the art, programming, and audio departments to realize the
              visual design and feel of the game.  Since I became the Design Producer midway through the project, most of my time was spent polishing
              the game.  To enhance player experience, I designed systems to accommodate different physical abilities and VR setups, such as point teleportation,
              and a settings menu to change the player's height.  I also corrected an issue where tasks were unclear, with players often getting lost
              during playtests.  As a result, I helped develop various quality of life features, such as helper screens placed at workstations showing
              diagrams of how to perform the current task, or arrows that glow over the workstations where the player should be.
              <br>
              <br>
              As a Programmer, I was primarily focused on fixing bugs, implementing new tasks and systems, and combining previously created features into
              a cohesive level.  I worked with an established code base contributed to by many different programmers, many of whom were no longer involved
              with the project.  Because of this, I had to familiarize myself with the established code of previous programmers, so that I could work on the game.

          Moist Party is a 4 player game where you play as slime people competing in a variety of lab test minigames, akin to Mario party.  This was
          my capstone game project at UCI.  It was created by a 6 person team in which I served as a Designer and Programmer.  I primarily worked
          with the minigames themselves, designing and programming a variety of games ranging from platformers, to top down brawlers, to quick
          reaction competitions.
          <br>
          <br>

          I also worked on gathering feedback for our minigames from playtesters, supervising their play sessions with the game. I notated places where they
          would get confused or stuck, as well as ask them questions about what they thought of each minigame.  From their responses, I determined the problems
          they were having, and the solutions we could implement to fix them.  Polish was another one of my responsibilities.  I focused on "finding the fun"
          in our game, trying to create the chaotic couch multiplayer party game that we envisioned it to be.  This included adding exaggerated animations,
          squishy slime sounds, and sporadic slime particles when jumping and getting hit.

            Toybox Bots was a card game created as a class project.  It is a 2 player game where cards represent either the head, torso, or feet
            of a robot.  Each player combines these to create robots, which then fight each other.  Each piece has different stats and abilities.
            My role in the group was creating the rules for the game.  Much time went into creating each phase of a player's turn, balancing between
            keeping the rules simple enough to not be confusing, and deep enough to keep players interested.  This was condensed into a rules pamphlet,
            worded in such a way that a player new to the game could easily pick it up.

          Created during a 24 hour game jam, Flower Feast is a 2D Unity game inspired by Minicraft (not Minecraft).  You play as Rosy, a Rose in a
          flowerpot with wheels, who goes around collecting ingredients to create a variety of different cuisines.  Various materials are found in
          different environments across the map, with some only being obtainable by defeating enemies.  I worked as a Designer and Programmer for
          the game.  As a Designer, I helped decide what the overall game loop and systems should be. As a Programmer, I worked on creating the player
          and enemies to populate the map.  This involved creating their movement, attacks, and behavior.  I also worked on implementing their
          animations, utilizing Unity's blend trees to create smooth transitions between different animations.

            Roach Game is a local asymmetric multiplayer party game.  It was created as a part of a 5 person team over the course of 3 months.
            It involves one person playing as a roach and the other playing as a human.  The human's job is to kill the roach within the time limit,
            while the roach must survive.  Our goal with the game was to utilize size in a unique way.  Many multiplayer games have you play as similar
            characters, with their size, and movement capabilities being very much the same.  In Roach Game, the human is nearly 50x taller than
            the roach.  The roach is small and nimble, being able to scale walls and run under objects in an attempt to outmaneuver and escape the human.
            I served as the main Programmer for the project, creating the movement and camera for the first person human and third person roach.
            I also programmed all of the human’s weapons and a system for them to swap between them, complete with animation trees for attacking and switching.
