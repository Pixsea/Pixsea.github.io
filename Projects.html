              Patient Zero is a virtual reality game that was developed in Unity. It was created in association with the department of
              Biology at the University of California Irvine, and is geared towards conveying biological concepts in an interactive manner.
              I served as the design producer and a programmer for the project.
              <br>
              <br>
              As design producer, I maintaned the game's design document, and coordinated the art, programming, and audio departments 
              to realize the visual design and feel of the game.  Since I became the design producer midway through the project, most of my time
              was spent polishing the game.  To enhance player experience I designed systems to accomodate for different physcial abilities
              and VR setups, such as point teleportation, and a settings menu to chaneg the player's height.  Another problem we had was that
              tasks were often unclear, with players often being lost during playtests.  Becuase of this, I helped develop various quality
              of life features, such as helper screens placed at workstation showing diagrams of how to perform the current task, or arrows
              that glow over workstations the player should be at currently.
              <br>
              <br>
              As a programmer I was mainly tasked with fixing bugs, implementing new tasks and systems, and combining previouslyc reated features into 
              a cohesive level.  I worked with an established code based worked on by many different programmers, many of which weren't on the
              project anymore.  Becuase of this, I had to familiarize myself with the established code of previous programmers so that I could
              work ont he game.

          Moist Party is a 4 player local multiplayer game in which players play as slime people competing in avariety of lab test minigames akin to Mario party,
          and was my capstone game project for UCI.  It was created by a 6 person team in which I served as a designer and programmer.  I mainly worked
          with the minigames themselves, designing and programming a variety of games ranging from platformers, to top down brawlers, to quick reaction competitions.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also worked with getting feedback for our minigames from playtesters, supervising their play sessions with the game. I would note any places where
          they would get confused or stuck, as well as ask them questions about what they thought of each each minigame.  From their resposnes, I helped to figure
          out what problems they were having, and what solutions we could implement to fix it.  Polish was another one of my responsibilities.  I mainly focused
          on "finding the fun" in our game, trying to create the chaotic couch multiplayer party game that we invisioend the game as.  This included adding
          exaggerated aniamtions, squishy slime sounds, and sporadic slime particles when jumping and being hit.

            Toybox Bots was a card game created as a class project in a group of five.  It is a 2 player game where cards represent
            either the head, torso, or feet of a robot.  Each player combiens these create robots, which then fight eachother.  Each
            piece has different stats and abilities.  My role in the group was creating the rules for the game.  Lots of time went into
            creating each phase of a player's turn, balacning between keeping the rules simple enough to be not too complicated, and deep enough
            to keep players interested.  This all needed to be condesed into a rules pamphlet, worded in such a way that a player new to the game
            could easily pick it up.

          Created during a 24 hour game jam, Flower Feast is a 2D Unity game inspired by Minicraft.  The player plays as Rosy, a Rose in a flowerpot with wheels,
          who goes around collecting ingredients to create a variety of different cuisines.  Different materials are found in different environments across the map, 
          with some only being obtainable by defeating enemies.  I worked as a designer and programmer for the game deciding upon the overall game loop and systems for the game.
          As a programmer, I worked on creating the player and enemies to populate the map.  This involved creating their movement, attacks, and behavior.  I also worked towards
          implmenting their animations, utilizing Unity's blend trees to create smooth transitions between different animations.

            Roach Game is a local assymetric multiplayer party game.  I created as a part of a 5 man team over the course of 3 months.
            It involves one player playing as a roach and one player playing as a human.  The humans job is to kill the roach within the time limit,
            While the roach must survive.  Our goal with the game was to utilize size in a unique way.  Many multiplayer games have the players play
            as similar characters, with their size, and mvoement cpaabilities being very close to oen another.  In Roach Game, the human is nearly
            50x taller than the roach,  while the roach is small and nimble, being able to scale walls and run under objects to try to outmaneuver
            and escape the human.  I served as the main programmer for the project, creating the movement and camera for the first person human
            and third person roach.  I also created all of the humans weapons and a system for them to swap between them, complete with attacking
            and switching animation trees.
